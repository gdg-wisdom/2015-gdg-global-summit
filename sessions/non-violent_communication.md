# Non-Violent Communication

##Communication or conflicts

Don't jump straight to conclusions, judgment.. everyone is trying to fulfill their underlying needs / feelings.

The takeaway is to look at the conflicts during communications in different ways and try to handle them in proper way. win win.

## Conflicts over emails:

Never ever try to resolve conflicts in email. 9 out of 10 times it will fail.

instead

offer empathy back. Try personal communication, phone, video, face to face meeting.
