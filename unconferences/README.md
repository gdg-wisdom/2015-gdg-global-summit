# Unconferences

Unconferences are impromptu "breakout sessions" based on organic discussions between participants interested in a specific topic.

These sessions are being scheduled in Green Room 2 (G2) on a first-come-first-served basis. Session topics and group coordination is likely to occur through the related [*#unconference* GDG Summit Slack Channel](https://gdgsummit.slack.com/messages/unconference/details/).
